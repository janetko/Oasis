A short description of Oasis (its purpose and features): Oasis is designed to give Cornell students a space to stay in touch with friends, create connections with others, and most importantly take care of themselves by checking in daily.

How Oasis addresses each of the requirements: Login authentication Store user data in a database (id, username, etc) Groups table in the database for specific mental health groups (ex. POC, anxiety etc.) Posts table in the database for specific posts from a user Specific routes for each page on the application Deploy so that multiple users can contribute/access at the same time
